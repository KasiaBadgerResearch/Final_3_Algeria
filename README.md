# Does the prevalence of adults without formal education coincide with urban population growth in Algeria between 1965 and 2010?

## Abstract

Education and urbanization are two key pillars of development, yet their interaction in Algeria has not been directly compared over the long run. This study uses World Bank World Development Indicators to examine trends in the percentage of adults aged 15+ without formal education and the annual rate of urban population growth from 1965 to 2010. Findings show a dramatic decline in the share of adults without education, while urban population growth remained comparatively stable. These descriptive results suggest that Algeria’s educational improvements unfolded largely independently of urbanization pressures. The analysis highlights the importance of considering both demographic change and policy reforms when assessing development progress.

## 1. Question

Does the prevalence of adults without formal education coincide with urban population growth in Algeria between 1965 and 2010?

- **Proxy for urbanization**: Urban population growth (annual %)
- **Measure of education**: Population ages 15+ with no formal education (%)

## 2. Data

- **Source**: World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)
- **Indicators**:
  - Urban population growth (annual %)
  - Population ages 15+ with no formal education (%)
- **Coverage**: Algeria, 1965–2010 (years with available data only)
- **Notes**: Only national-level data; some years missing.

## 3. Method

1. Filtered dataset for Algeria.
2. Selected relevant columns: Year, Indicator Name, Value.
3. Pivoted indicators into separate columns and sorted by year.
4. Produced a line graph comparing adult education and urban population growth over time.

(Analysis is descriptive; no causal inference applied.)

## 4. Results

- **Adults without formal education**: Declined substantially across the period, especially after the 1970s.
- **Urban population growth**: Remained relatively steady, showing limited variation across decades.
- **Comparison**: Educational gains did not move in tandem with urban growth, suggesting independent drivers.

(Table 1. Pivoted dataset)

## 5. Interpretation

- Algeria achieved major improvements in education, reducing the share of adults without schooling.
- Urban growth rates were steady, meaning demographic expansion was not the main driver of rising education levels.
- These findings imply that policy efforts and institutional reforms, rather than urbanization alone, played a central role in advancing education.

## 6. Limitations

- Only two indicators analyzed.
- Gaps exist for some years.
- National-level data only; no regional breakdowns.
- No causal relationships tested.

## 7. Next Steps / Extensions

- Add complementary indicators (e.g., literacy rates, school enrollment).
- Incorporate subnational/regional data to capture heterogeneity.
- Test causal pathways with econometric models.
- Situate Algeria’s trajectory within a comparative North African context.
